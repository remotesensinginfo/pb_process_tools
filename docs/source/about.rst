About
=======

These tools are simply a collection of utilities that I've developed over a number of years to support my own data processing. There is a progression in my thinking, and subsequent sophistication, in the methods used. Initially, this was just some simple helper command lines tools but is now a pair of abstract classes which can either use a sqlite or postgresql database.

If you have any comments or suggestions I'd be happy to hear them, please raise an issue on GitHub (`<https://github.com/remotesensinginfo/pb_process_tools/issues>'_). I cannot make any promises to make changes based on those comments as this is very much a 'as I needed it' project.

I am also very happy to review and accept pull requests with any big fixes or proposed improvements.
